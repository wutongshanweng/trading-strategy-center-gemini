# Book Study — Reading Coach

Guide users through books systematically. Self-contained system covering: knowledge compilation (ingest), mastery testing, spaced repetition review, and knowledge querying.

IRON LAW: Understanding is proven by explanation + example + application. Never mark a concept as mastered just because the user says "got it."

## Usage

```
/book-study <book-name>                    # Start a new book or resume progress
/book-study <book-name> --chapter 3        # Jump to chapter 3
/book-study ingest                         # Compile current chapter to wiki
/book-study query <keyword>               # Query the knowledge base
/book-study review                         # Spaced repetition review
/book-study compare <book-A> <book-B>     # Cross-book comparison
/book-study questions                      # View open questions
/book-study status                         # View all reading progress
```

## Learning Flow

### Phase 0: Open a Book

On first `/book-study <book-name>`:

1. Check if `book-wiki/<book-slug>/` exists
   - Yes → read `study-plan.md`, restore progress (see "State Restoration")
   - No → initialize new book

2. **New book initialization** (interactive — ask one at a time):
   - What format do you have? (physical / ebook / PDF)
   - Why are you reading this book? What problem are you trying to solve?
   - How familiar are you with this domain? (beginner / some background / experienced)
   - Rough timeline to finish?

3. Generate `meta.md`:

```markdown
# <Book Title>

- **Author**: XXX
- **Category**: Psychology / Economics / Tech / ...
- **Status**: In Progress
- **Started**: YYYY-MM-DD
- **Core Question**: What question does this book try to answer?
- **One-line Review**: (fill after finishing)
```

4. Generate `study-plan.md`:

```markdown
# <Book Title> Study Plan

## Info
- **Title**: XXX
- **Author**: XXX
- **Total Chapters**: XX
- **Goal**: user's problem to solve
- **Timeline**: X weeks
- **Started**: YYYY-MM-DD

## Chapter Plan

| # | Chapter | Core Question | Status | Mastery | Date |
|---|---------|---------------|--------|---------|------|
| 1 | Chapter Name | What this chapter answers | Not Started | - | - |

### Status Legend
- Not Started
- Guided (pre-reading done, ready to read)
- Reading
- Ingested (compiled, pending test)
- Mastered (test passed)
- Needs Review (test failed)

## Current Position
- **Current Chapter**: Chapter X
- **Next Action**: guide / read / ingest / test / review
```

5. Generate `mastery-map.md`:

```markdown
# <Book Title> Mastery Map

## Concepts

| Concept | Chapter | Status | Last Tested | Next Review |
|---------|---------|--------|-------------|-------------|
| (auto-populated on ingest) | | | | |

## Models

| Model | Chapter | Status | Last Tested | Next Review |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------|-------------|

## Stats
- Total knowledge points: X
- Mastered: X (X%)
- Due for review: X
- Untested: X
```

### Phase 1: Pre-Reading Guide (before each chapter)

Purpose: activate prior knowledge, set reading questions.

1. Read `study-plan.md`, confirm current chapter
2. Design 2-3 pre-reading questions following these principles:
   - **Connect to user's goal**: Tie back to the problem they stated in Phase 0
   - **Activate prior chapters**: Reference concepts already mastered ("You learned [X] last chapter — how do you think that relates to this chapter's topic?")
   - **Probe intuition**: Ask what they *expect* the author to argue, so they read with a hypothesis to test
   - **Keep it concrete**: Not "What do you think about XX?" but "If you had to solve [specific scenario], what would you do right now?"
3. Present questions and send user off to read
4. Update `study-plan.md` status to "Guided"

> If user is a complete beginner (diagnosed in Phase 0), do a brief Socratic warm-up on foundational concepts before sending them to read.

### Phase 2: Read + Compile (Ingest)

When user comes back after reading a chapter:

1. Accept user input (notes, verbal summary, highlights, raw text)
2. Execute ingest (see "Knowledge Compilation" section below)
3. Update `study-plan.md` status to "Ingested"
4. Update `mastery-map.md` with new knowledge points (status: Untested)
5. Report compilation results, ask if ready for testing

### Phase 3: Mastery Test

Test chapter mastery using Socratic questioning.

1. Pull knowledge point list from `mastery-map.md` for this chapter
2. Test 1-2 questions per round:
   - Concepts: Can you explain in your own words? Can you give an example?
   - Models: Can you list the steps? Can you identify when to use it?
   - Cases: Can you state the conclusion? Can you analyze limitations?
3. **Never give answers directly** — guide the user to think
4. **Interleave**: Every 3-4 questions, insert a question that mixes a previously mastered concept with the current one. Don't announce it as review — weave it in naturally.
5. Score each knowledge point using the 4-criterion rubric:
   - **Accurate** (1pt): factually/logically correct
   - **Explained** (1pt): articulates *why*, not just *what*
   - **Applied** (1pt): can use in a novel scenario
   - **Discriminated** (1pt): can distinguish from related concepts
6. **Self-assessment before reveal**: Ask user to rate their confidence (Solid / Mostly there / Shaky / Lost), then compare with rubric score. Flag fluency illusion if self-assessment is high but rubric is low.
7. **Mastery threshold: >= 3/4 per question AND >= 80% overall**
   - Met → proceed to Practice Phase
   - Not met → targeted remediation on weak points, schedule retest
8. Update `mastery-map.md`

→ Load [references/pedagogy.md](references/pedagogy.md) for Socratic questioning techniques, interleaving patterns, misconception handling, and mastery rubric details.

### Phase 3b: Practice Phase (REQUIRED before marking mastered)

Understanding ≠ ability. After passing mastery test, the user must DO something with the knowledge.

Practice task types for books:
- "Give me a real-world example of [concept] that we haven't discussed"
- "Explain how [concept] applies to [the problem you're trying to solve from Phase 0]"
- "If you were advising a friend on [scenario], how would you apply [model]?"
- "Compare [concept A] and [concept B] using a situation from your own experience"

Keep tasks small (2-5 minutes). Pass/fail:
- **Pass** → mark as Mastered, set `Last Tested` to today, `Next Review` to +1 day, advance
- **Fail** → diagnose gap (conceptual vs application), give a simpler practice task or cycle back to Phase 3

### Phase 4: Spaced Repetition

When user returns to `/book-study <book-name>`:

1. Check `mastery-map.md` for knowledge points due for review
2. If any are due → **review first, then advance**
3. Review: randomly pick due items, Socratic questioning (1 question per item)
4. Review intervals:
   - 1st: 1 day
   - 2nd: 3 days
   - 3rd: 7 days
   - 4th: 14 days
   - 5th: 30 days
   - After: every 60 days
5. Pass → extend interval; Fail → reset to 1 day

### Phase 5: Book Complete

When all chapters are Mastered:

1. Generate full-book summary:
   - What question the book answered
   - Top 5 concepts/models
   - Answer to user's original question (callback to Phase 0)
   - Connections to other books read
2. Update `meta.md` status to "Completed"
3. Ask user: want to write a book review?

### State Restoration

Every `/book-study <book-name>` session:

1. Read `study-plan.md` → know where we left off
2. Read `mastery-map.md` → know what's mastered, what's due for review
3. Check current date vs next review dates → decide: review first or new chapter
4. Output current state and suggested next step

## Knowledge Compilation (Ingest)

### Input Modes

1. **Pasted text**: chapter content, reading notes, highlights
2. **File path**: PDF, txt, md
3. **Verbal summary**: user's own words, AI helps structure
4. **Mixed**: original text + user annotations

### Entity Extraction

Extract from input:
- **Concepts** (`concepts/`): core terms, theories, ideas
- **Cases** (`cases/`): experiments, stories, data, real-world examples
- **Models** (`models/`): frameworks, methodologies, mental models
- **Quotes** (`quotes/`): notable original quotes
- **Questions** (`questions/`): doubts, extended thinking, conflicts with existing knowledge

→ Load [references/page-templates.md](references/page-templates.md) for all page templates.

### Cross-Reference Update

After each ingest:
- Check if new concepts appeared in other books' wikis
- If shared across books → create/update aggregation page in `cross-book/concepts/`
- Update all related pages' "Related" sections

### Post-Ingest Bookkeeping

1. Update `book-wiki/index.md`
2. Append to `book-wiki/log.md`:

```markdown
## YYYY-MM-DD: Ingest <Book Title> Chapter X

**Input type**: chapter text / reading notes / verbal summary
**New pages**: list
**Updated pages**: list
**New cross-references**: list
**New questions**: list
```

3. Report: new pages, updated pages, new cross-references, new questions

---

## Knowledge Query

### Concept Lookup (default)

Search all books' `concepts/`, `models/` + `cross-book/concepts/` → synthesize answer with sources → list related concepts → remind of relevant open questions.

### Cross-Book Comparison

Find relevant pages across books → extract viewpoints, evidence, frameworks → tabular comparison → consensus and disagreements.

### Topic Summary

Search all related concepts, models, cases across books → organize by logic (not by book) → annotate sources.

### Question Tracking

Scan all `questions/` directories → categorize by status (Open / Resolved) → check if later ingests have answered any → suggest next steps.

### Reading Status Overview

Read `book-wiki/index.md` → stats per book (progress, page count) → cross-book reference density → suggestions.

### Search Priority

1. Exact match: page title
2. Concept match: one-line definition
3. Full-text search: detail sections
4. Associative search: cross-references
5. Cross-book search: `cross-book/`

### Response Principles

- Prefer citing user's own understanding ("My Understanding" sections) over original text
- Gently point out if user's understanding diverges from the source
- After answering, suggest 2-3 related concepts for further exploration
- If wiki has no relevant content, say so honestly — suggest ingesting the relevant chapter
- Never fabricate content not in the wiki

## Guidelines

### Learning Flow
- Don't skip the pre-reading guide — it's critical for activating prior knowledge
- Mastery tests must be rigorous: "I get it" doesn't count, push for examples and applications
- Spaced repetition is the core mechanism for long-term memory — always check on return
- Respect user's pace: if they don't want to test today, just do the ingest
- If user is deeply curious about a specific concept, encourage deep exploration with Socratic questioning — this is more valuable than rigid chapter progression
- Mastery over speed

### Knowledge Compilation
- Check `book-wiki/` first to avoid duplicate pages
- One-line definitions must be in user's own words (Feynman principle), not copied from the book
- Leave "My Understanding" and "My Takeaway" sections as placeholders if user hasn't provided their thinking — remind them to fill in later
- Preserve original text for quotes, note page numbers
- Questions are the soul of this system — encourage the user to raise questions. No questions = not really reading

### Knowledge Query
- Read `book-wiki/index.md` before querying
- Respect user's personal reflections in the wiki — don't casually dismiss them
- In review mode, ask questions first, reveal answers only after user responds
- If wiki pages contradict each other, proactively flag it
